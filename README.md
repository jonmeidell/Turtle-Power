# `Turtle Power! RPG game.`
![Welcome!](https://jonmeidell.github.io/assets/images/tmnt.gif)

This is a strategy game where you choose your own character, from the 4 turtles we have grown-up with and love, and battle against the rest of your brothers, one-by-one, until there is only one left standing.

Your power increases during your spars with your brothers.

#### Improvements to be made:
  * _Tweak the looks a little bit to have a better arrangement of cards, etc. (tried center justification, but created more bugs)_
