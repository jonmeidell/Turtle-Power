# Turtle Power! RPG game.

A strategy game where you choose your own character, from the 4 turtles we have grown-up with and love, and battle against the rest of your borthers, one-by-one, until there is only one left standing.  Your power increases during your spars with your brother.

Fix to be made:
      Tweak the looks a little bit to have a better arrangement of cards, etc.
